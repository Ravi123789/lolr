## Special Instructions:

1. **Focus on Analytics**: This is a desktop-first analytics platform, not a mobile Mini App
2. **Rich Data Visualization**: Invest heavily in charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations
3. **Portfolio Approach**: Think like a portfolio manager analyzing multiple investments
4. **Community-Driven**: Include features for users to share insights and collaborate
5. **Documentation-Heavy**: Include comprehensive docs for all integrations and features
6. **No Mini App Features**: Skip Farcaster SDK, social sharing, and Mini App manifest
7. **Enhanced Database**: Use more sophisticated data models for analytics
8. **ML Integration**: Include basic machine learning for predictions and analysis

This creates a significantly different application that serves analysts, researchers, and serious Web3 users who need deep insights rather than quick mobile interactions.
