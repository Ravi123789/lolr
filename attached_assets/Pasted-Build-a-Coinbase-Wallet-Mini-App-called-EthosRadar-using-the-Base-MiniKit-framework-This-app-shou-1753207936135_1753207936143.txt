Build a Coinbase Wallet Mini App called "EthosRadar" using the Base MiniKit framework.
This app should focus on the Ethos Protocol, allowing users to scan wallet reputations, analyze trust networks, view R4R (Reciprocal Review) analytics, track wallets, and set up trust alerts.
The UI/UX should match the Coinbase Wallet Mini App style with modern animations, live interactions, clean fonts, dark/light theme toggle, and interactive graphs.

Here’s an updated, enhanced prompt for Replit Agent, with unique features beyond just R4R, and explicitly asking it to test all Ethos APIs, ensure real data is fetched, and design the app with viral-worthy UX/UI and interactive elements like "Flex Your Trust Score" button.

⚙️ Replit Agent Prompt (Final)
Build a Coinbase Wallet Mini App called "EthosRadar" using the Base MiniKit framework.

This mini app should deeply integrate with the Ethos Protocol and go far beyond the existing R4R app. Your goal is to make it more useful, more viral, and visually stunning, with interactive reputation tools.

🧠 Key Functional Features:
✅ 1. Wallet Reputation Scanner
User enters any wallet address and sees full reputation profile:

Trust Score

Number of trusted accounts

Trust categories

Recent changes in reputation

Use Ethos API v2/v1 endpoints. Must test live data and ensure responses are accurate.

🕸 2. Trust Network Graph
Display a 2D or radial graph showing:

Who trusts this wallet

Who they trust

Strength of trust lines

Use d3.js or vis.js to animate the graph.

💬 3. "Flex Your Trust Score" Button
A viral feature: Add a "Cast" button to let users brag about their Trust Score publicly.

Example output:

“🛡 Just scanned my @ethos reputation — I have 87% Trust Score with 24 mutual trusters. Check your score on EthosRadar 🔍”

Include auto-generated image or badge (optional) to share in Farcaster or Lens.

⚖️ 4. Unique R4R Analyzer
Build your own version of the R4R scoring system, using core logic from ethos-r4r repo, but:

Add extra data like date of first review, frequency of interactions, etc.

Show a heatmap of trust intensity over time.

🧠 5. Wallet Watchlist + Alerts
Allow users to watch specific wallets.

Notify when:

Trust score drops

They get trusted/untrusted by others

You can simulate push notifications or use visual alerts for this mini app.

🧩 Design & UX Requirements:
Match Coinbase Wallet Mini App UI:

Clean layout, mobile-first

Dark + light toggle

Rounded cards, smooth animations, rich hover/tap effects

Use Framer Motion or Lottie for cool UI animations

Add loading shimmer skeletons when fetching API data

Include tooltips or badges for trust levels (e.g. "Highly Trusted", "New Wallet", etc.)

Build a tool people will love to share, trust to use, and brag about.
